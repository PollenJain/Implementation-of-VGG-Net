Sequence to follow for transfer learning :

1. Train the model for 1 epoch and save it.
2. After Training, load the model.
	2.1 Pass the training data images to the trained model.
	2.2 Save the feature vector from the last layer for each of the training image along with their labels.
		1 feature per image. It is a 1024 dimensional feature vector.
		1 label per image.
		It should look like this : [ , , , , , ...., ] of dimension 1x1024 and label 1
	2.3 Call this trainXForClassifier, trainYForClassifier
	
	2.4 Repeat 2.1 to 2.2 with test images along with their labels.
	2.4 Call this testXForClassifier, testYForClassifier
	
					or
					
2. After Training, load the model. 
	2.1 Pass the entire dataset through the trained model. 
	2.2 Save the feature vector from the last layer for each of the training image along with their labels.
		1 feature per image. It is a 1024 dimensional feature vector.
		1 label per image.
		It should look like this : [ , , , , , ...., ] of dimension 1x1024 and label 1

3 Now you can split it to training and testing dataset depending on your needs (maybe 70 percent training and 30 percent testing)
	


Checklist :
Step no 1: Train the model for 1 epoch and save it.
Status: Doing. Save as one_epoch.model and label_binarizer.pickle.
Cmd used : python train.py --dataset C:\Users\paragjai\Desktop\DesktopBackup\College\aml\aml_project\smallerVGGNet\datasets --model one_epoch.model --labelbin label_binarizer.pickle
Status: Done. Saved as one_epoch.model and label_binarizer.pickle.

Step no 2: Pass the entire dataset through the trained model, extract the feature vectors and save it.
Status: Doing. Save as features_vectors_with_corresponding_labels.csv 
Cmd used : python extract_feature_vectors.py --dataset C:\Users\paragjai\Desktop\DesktopBackup\College\aml\aml_project\smallerVGGNet\datasets --model one_epoch.model
Status: Done. Save as features_vectors_with_corresponding_labels.csv
